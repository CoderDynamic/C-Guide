        <p><b>What is career counselling?</b></p>
<p>Most of the students are confused for their career and professionals are stressed up.  Unlike past, today a lot of career opportunities are available in India.  More than 3000+ career options are available only in India to choose from.  To know about all these career options and to pick the best one is really difficult. We need a professional career counselling.</p>

<p>Career counselling is a systematic process where career counsellor helps student and working professionals to make informed career decisions.</p> 

<p>Career counselling cannot be biased towards parents or towards students. Neither career counsellor can pick their own preferences.  Career counselling is the completely unbiased process. It is purely based on studentâ€™s personality, Career interest, career motivators and his aptitude.</p>

<p>Career counselling in India is very popular now and more and more students are opting for it.</p>

<p><b>Why is career counselling important?</b><br>
Career counselling provides better understand and clarity about the career.  It saves a lot of time, money, frustration because of career indecisiveness. A career counsellor not only helps the student to find out the most suitable career option but also provide a detailed execution plan.</p>

<p>Informed career decisions- Career counselling helps to make informed career decisions.</p>

<p>Clear Education and Career Road Map -  Students will get a clear educational and career road map. Early-stage career counselling always gives more time for execution.</p>

<p>Career Satisfaction - Thing about to pursue a career that you love to. Career counsellor explores your interest areas, personality and abilities and based on that fins out most suitable career option for you.</p>

<p>Career Opportunities -  Today a lot of career opportunities and new aged career options are available. Most of the students and professionals are not aware of these career opportunities, latest trends, salary packages and much more crucial information that plays an important role to select a career option.  Trained career counsellors always update themselves for all such crucial information and systematically guide students to make the right career decision.  A career in data science, a career in artificial intelligence, a career in digital marketing and many newer aged career options.</p>
